# Python-backend-experience
My first project as a Python backend dev using Django on GitHub.

I was able to build a to-do API, ofcourse in collaboration with a brother and friend.

The API is useful to create, edit and delete for now.

Side Hustle 5.0 Bootcamp Portfolio Python Team 2 - todoapp API project for Week 2. In collaboration with Taiwo Hassan and others

The ListTodo can be viewed using http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/

The DetailTodo view can be accessed via http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/1/

The TodoApp allows users to set reminders.
